        <h1>ABOUT CACHE MEMORY</h1>
        <p>Cache memory is a high-speed and small-sized volatile computer memory that provides fast data access to the processor. It temporarily stores frequently accessed instructions and data, reducing the latency in fetching them from slower main memory. This helps improve overall system performance by minimizing the time the CPU spends waiting for data.</p>
        <h3>Some Types Of Cache Memory</h3>
        <p><u>L1 Cache (Level 1)</u>: Located within the CPU, it is the smallest but fastest cache, holding frequently used instructions and data for quick access.</p>
        <p><u>L2 Cache (Level 2)</u>: Positioned between the CPU and RAM, it is larger than L1 cache and helps bridge the speed gap between the CPU and main memory.</p>
        <p><u>L3 Cache (Level 3)</u>: A shared cache that can be present on some multicore processors. It serves as a collective resource for multiple CPU cores, enhancing overall system performance.</p>

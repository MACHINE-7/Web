        <h1>ABOUT DRAM</h1>
        <p>SDynamic Random-Access Memory (DRAM) is a volatile computer memory that stores data in capacitors within a cell. It requires constant refreshing to maintain stored information, distinguishing it from static RAM (SRAM). Common in system memory, DRAM offers high density but with slower access speeds compared to SRAM.</p>
        <h3>Some Types Of DRAM</h3>
        <p><u>DDR3 RAM:</u> DDR3 (Double Data Rate 3) is an older RAM standard known for its moderate speed and energy efficiency. It was widely used in computers and laptops, offering decent performance for its time. [Speed: 1600 - 1800 MHz]</p>
        <p><u>DDR4 RAM:</u> DDR4 (Double Data Rate 4) is a more recent and faster RAM standard, providing improved bandwidth and energy efficiency over DDR3. It is commonly found in modern computers, servers, and high-performance devices. [Speed: MHz]</p>
        <p><u>DDR5 RAM:</u> DDR5 (Double Data Rate 5) is the latest RAM standard, offering even higher data transfer rates and increased efficiency compared to DDR4. It is designed to meet the demands of advanced computing tasks and emerging technologies, providing enhanced performance for cutting-edge systems. [Speed: MHz]</p>

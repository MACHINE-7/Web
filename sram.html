        <h1>ABOUT SRAM</h1>
        <p>Static Random-Access Memory (SRAM) is a type of volatile semiconductor memory that stores data using bistable flip-flop circuits. SRAM is faster than dynamic RAM (DRAM), doesn't require constant refreshing, and retains data as long as power is supplied. It's commonly used for cache memory in CPUs and other high-speed applications.</p>
        <h3>Some Features About SRAM</h3>
        <p><u>High-Speed Access:</u> SRAM offers rapid data retrieval with low latency, enabling quick read and write operations in electronic devices.</p>
        <p><u>Volatility:</u> Unlike DRAM, SRAM retains data without constant refreshing, providing non-volatile storage suitable for cache memory in computers and processors.</p>
        <p><u>Low Power Consumption:</u> 3. SRAM consumes less power compared to DRAM, making it energy-efficient for applications demanding low standby power and extended battery life.</p>
